# `core`

Welcome to the `core` package. Simulo adds this package to your `packages` and replaces it every time you change Simulo versions (we check the `cache/last_version.txt` file), or when the `packages` directory is created.

All of the built-in Simulo tools are defined here!

You can prevent Simulo from adding/replacing `core` by setting `replace_core` to `false` in your `config.toml`.
